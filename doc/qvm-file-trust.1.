.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qvm\-file\-trust
can check and modify the

.PP
A file is considered trusted unless:
.PP
1. It sits under an untrusted folder's path
.PP
2. It has a 'user.qubes.untrusted' extended file attribute
.PP
3. It sits in a file path that has the phrase 'untrusted' in it. This phrase can be configured in /etc/qubes/always-open-in-dispvm.phrase
.PP
A '-' character can be placed in front of a path in the local list to override a path listed in the local list.
